# Overview

This configuration for neovim is intended to be very small in convinience that it remains compitable, clean and easily maintainable.

It contains only some basic settings and a few of my favourite plugins, so it can be easily set up after a clean installation and serve as a boilerplate for the further customisation.

# Requirements

- neovim >= 0.7.2
- terminal emulator with the extended support for colors

# Plugins

- packer.nvim
- lualine.nvim
- catppuccin colorscheme
